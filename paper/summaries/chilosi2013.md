A major dividing line can be drawn between those that stress regional and national market integration for the early modern period (Achilles, 1957; Abel, 1980; Unger, 1983; Allen and Unger, 1990; Persson, 1999; Clark, 2002; Jacks, 2004), and the proponents of the increasingly influential “big-bang” hypothesis, for whom European integration suddenly occurred in the first half of the nineteenth century (O'Rourke and Williamson, 2002: 39–45 ff.; Özmucur and Pamuk, 2007; Bateman, 2011; Federico, 2011; Uebele, 2011).

Works on regional markets, for example, are likely to suggest that integration began in the early modern period, while those looking at longer-distance trade are more likely to find a “big bang” in the nineteenth century.

Notwithstanding the debate about the 1800 dividing line, most scholars would certainly agree that the reach of the market in 1650 was largely local or regional. Also, few would disagree that by World War I, there were global markets for most commodities.

With this analysis we show that European grain market integration was gradual and step-wise, rather than sudden. Our larger
coverage allows us to be at least partly sceptical about the view that continental integration stagnated in the earlymodern years.We find price convergence, particularly between the later seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth century. Also, from the mid-eighteenth century price co-movement began to rise. Investigating patterns of integration across distances suggests that, instead of a “big-bang”, there were multiple phases of integrations with a gradually expanding geographical reach. Even if a continental market emerged only in the nineteenth century, we detect widespread regional integration in the early modern years.

The regions we endogenously identify suggest that **there are significant limitations with the use of states or the continent as a whole for the study of early modern integration: markets tended to be located within relatively short-distances; geography – and access to the sea in particular – more directly than political borders determined the markets' location and size.**

(aside: fair. but I'm holding geography and access to the sea constant, and analyse the effect of a change in political borders ceteris paribus. if I get no effect, then that may indicate that political borders really don't matter much at all.)

## European trends

(figures 2-4 tell the story; the below is context)

A long-term trend towards market integration in the early modern period is evident from the perspective of price dispersion. Specifically, we find that this decreased markedly between the late seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth centuries; as in Federico (2011), from then until the French Revolution it remained stationary. [...] In short, our findings suggest that an improved coverage implies a revision of the picture of early modern European integration, from stagnation (cf. Bateman, 2011) to progress.

However, such a conclusion is only partly confirmed by our measures of efficiency. A long-term trend towards market integration continues to hold for volatility, albeit not as markedly as for price convergence. Discounting for short-term fluctuations, co-movement remained on the whole trendless until the end of the eighteenth century.14 As suggested by Pfister et al. (2011), this discrepancy between measures of efficiency may owe something to changing weather conditions. The end of the “Little Ice Age” (1400–1700), for example, coincided with a drop in price volatility.

This is likely to be only part of the story, though. The lack of long-term gains should not blind us to substantial increases in co-movement in the second half of the eighteenth century, at the same time as volatility was continuing to fall, and both trading costs and weather conditions appear to have been on the whole stable. This trend is in linewith other analyses (Allen and Unger, 1990; Persson, 1999; Jacks, 2004), and shows that it is in themid-eighteenth century that themodern rise in price co-movement originates: from then until the middle of the nineteenth century co-movement continued to rise almost without interruptions. This periodisation matches well the argument that modern European integration had its roots in earlier physiocratic reforms, as these initiated a period of market de-regulation whereby restrictions on the export of grains from localities were lifted (cf. Persson, 1999). Still it is difficult to reconcile this perspective with stationary trading costs in the second half of the eighteenth century. Conversely, the preceding fall invites to take seriously the achievements of mercantilist policies of state formation (cf. Epstein, 2000; Jacks, 2004), though the literature also emphasises improvements in shipping technology during the early modern era (cf. Unger, 1978, 1983, 2011).15 A plausible explanation for the pattern that we identify is that improved geopolitical conditions and better protection of property rights in the second half of the century allowed trade networks to become established.While the later seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth centuries were characterised by almost continuous major conflicts, this was not the case from the second half of the 1760s until the end of the 1780s. As a consequence the greater scope for arbitrage opportunities implied by the preceding fall in trading costs began to be regularly exploited.

Our data show that the French Wars and associated trading policies led to a marked increase in trading costs. As expected, prices became very unstable at the same time amidst a rampant inflation. Surprisingly, though, the correlation analysis does not identify a similar drop in price co-movement, which on the contrary continued to rise. Information flows within the French Empire may have implied that the destabilising effect of the Wars – a continental-wide shock –, were transmitted swiftly across continental markets.

As argued by Crouzet (1964), **the Napoleonic Wars had an ambivalent effect on European trade: while sea- and long-distance trade suffered, the abolition of internal trade barriers fostered the formation of larger domestic markets.** Yet Federico (2011: 109) finds only slight grain price convergence within the Empire, and increased price volatility contributed to the progress in co-movement. Hence, the actual improvement in efficiency during this period was probably smaller than implied by the correlation figures.

To sum up, while by and large the emerging consensus is confirmed from the Napoleonic Wars onwards, this is not the case
for the early modern period where we detect a long-term trend towards market integration. The analysis suggests that trading
costs markedly fell between the late seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth century. A significant increase in
operational efficiency followed, implying that the beginning of the modern rise in co-movement dates back to the second half
of the eighteenth century. To explain this pattern we advanced the hypothesis that the increased opportunities for arbitrage
opened up by **the initial decrease in trading costs began to be regularly exploited in the second half of the eighteenth century, thanks to improved geopolitical conditions.** (note: they mean the end of continuous major conflicts)

## Regional integration

Table 1, and especially Table 2, tells the story.

Distance is confirmed as the basic determinant of the extent of integration in the pre-railway period: nearly uniformly in all time periods, bar the late nineteenth century, price ratios increase and correlations decrease with distance; in the late nineteenth century, price ratios and, to a lesser extent, correlation coefficients become similar across distances. For the balanced sample, already by the mid-nineteenth, differences in price ratios across distance groups are no longer significant; by the later period this applies to correlation coefficients, too.

For the balanced sample, there is hardly any long-term reduction in price ratios for cities within 1500 km of each other
between the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries. On the contrary, these were slightly higher in 1816–1870 and
significantly higher in 1870–1913 than in 1715–1789. It is only very distant cities (>1500 km) that experienced a progressive,
albeit not statistically significant, reduction in price ratios. This pattern is partly confirmed by the unbalanced sample: after 1800 there was little or no change in price ratios between close cities (b150 km), but there were significant improvements beyond the local level.

In short, the results suggest that: firstly, consistent with the previous analysis, the modern growth in trade was preceded by an earlier reduction in trading costs; secondly, the European core integrated before the periphery20; and thirdly, despite setbacks during the French Wars and from the later nineteenth century, integration had a gradually expanding geographical reach. In other words, instead of a “big-bang” we find multiple and step-wise waves of grain market integration spanning the early modern/modern divide.

## Markets and countries

Typically, studies of European integration split the sample into countries (Jacks, 2005; Uebele, 2011; Bateman, 2011; Federico, 2011). This is certainly a meaningful observation unit, as several relevant factors like trade policy, currencies, legal systems or measurement units are often determined by state borders. But then state borders over the almost three centuries under study are not constant but changing considerably. What is more, there are other potential categorisations that do not follow national borders; geographical features may well be more important dividing lines, particularly in early modern Europe. Thus a different approach is warranted. The solution proposed here is to let the data speak for themselves on how to break up the database.

Figs. 5-7 tell the story.

### Early modern

in the early modern period geography, more markedly than political borders, loomed large as determinant of the shape, size and locations of markets. Both the 1620–1789 and the larger 1715–1789 samples show that markets typically cut across borders and, especially in large states, fragmented polities. [...] Although the Apennine peninsula anticipated the formation of an Italian state in the nineteenth century, the picture was complicated by the overlap with the Northern Mediterranean market. Similarly, trade links spanned across German states, but we fail to identify a common German market at the time.

(aside: this is interesting and worth mentioning, but not fine-grained enough to tell me anything useful about trade links between German states.)

The early modern picture is one of the segmentation with markets tending to be located within relatively short distances. [...] Beside distance, proximity to a particular sea such as the North Sea or the Mediterranean Sea clearly emerges as a major dividing line [in the early modern period]. Land-locked markets tended to be smaller: Helvetia and Central Europe were by far the smallest markets in 1620–1789. The same remark applies to Lower Saxony West, Lower Saxony East, Helvetia and Central France in 1715–1789. It therefore appears that physical geography and access to the sea in particular is not only an important dimension to add, but that is actually the most characteristic feature of grain markets in early modern Europe.

aside: (
    look at Fig. 6, with markets in 1715-1789. There are now multiple markets visible within Germany. Notably "Lower Saxony West" and "Lower Saxony East", as well as "Central Europe". As I was able to determine by overlaying the two maps from the paper in GIMP, West contains Osnabrück, Cologne, and Paderborn. East contains Braunschweig and Göttingen. Central Europe contains Minden, Braunschweig, Berlin, Munich, and Prague.
    
    Observation: Munich, Berlin, Braunschweig and Prague were all the capitals of big, important territories. And apparently prices in these capitals co-moved with each other in the 18th century. I'm not sure what the interpretation of that may be.
    
    Q: how did the territorial history of lower Saxony look in that period? Were there two big territories, and do the cities in the markets separate cleanly into those two?
    )

### Modern

(aside: this seems like an especially interesting section, because here geography stops dominating and nation-states (with their different trade policy choices) become a more important factor. The authors expand not only on international integration but also on *national integration* in this section.)

In contrast to the early modern picture, the emergence of a European market in the nineteenth century signals that physical geography mattered much less in modern times. As suggested by the recent literature, **a European market thus emerged only in the course of the nineteenth century, at the same time as steam, railways and trade liberalisation were eroding away long-standing differences across regions and geographies.**


All these countries [France, Switzerland], on the other hand, unlike, for example, Italy and Germany, were characterised by a long history of statehood. From this perspective, the finding is consistent with the hypothesis that **the modern growth of price co-movement between European cities was associated with early modern state formation** (cf. Section 4).

In short, we find that there was a shift from a segmented to an almost unified European market between the early modern years and the nineteenth century. The nineteenth century, however, saw also the growth of national markets in old states. In contrast, trade networks in early modern Europe were shaped by geographymore directly than by political borders, with access to seas providing major dividing lines. Coastal markets tended to be larger; it is only at the time of liberalism and the transport revolution that long-standing differences between the geographical endowments of land-locked and low-land regions in Europe were eroded.

## section 7

has mostly specifics; refer to it if you have a specific question

this is all still not granular enough to be directly relevant, but it has lots of useful context and theory.

**Both England and to a lesser extent the Netherlands were characterised by particularly early political centralisation** (Zuijderduijn, 2009: ch. 1; Epstein, 2000: 37), as well as heavy reliance on sea transport. There is further evidence that these two factors were important in shaping dynamics of early modern integration.

**[In the view of the public good character of the market (Epstein, 2000)], regions in large states like France and England were better-placed to enjoy the benefits of centralisation than those in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the German and Italian states. A milder form of absolutism and greater jurisdictional fragmentation than in France, however, implied little market integration in Spain, despite its size (Ertman, 1997: 110 ff.; Grafe, 2012).**

Fig. 8 and 9 have nice summary statistics.

**Central Europe saw the main gains in the later seventeenth century, at the same time as bureaucratic absolutism was coming to maturity (Ertman, 1997: 245).**

## Conclusion

Use this as the base for your summary, boil it down to a paragraph, and then add only immediately relevant parts from the above.

**We find that before liberalism and the transport revolution trade networks were shaped by geography more directly than by political borders: our markets were located within relatively short distances and access to seas provided major dividing lines.** Our results suggest significant limitations with the use of states and the continent as a whole as units of analysis of market integration for the early modern period. **Comparison across regions also highlights that only coastal markets achieved comparatively high levels of market integration in terms of both depth and breadth by the eighteenth century [...].**
