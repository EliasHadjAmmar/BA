# Literature writeup

This document aims to give a survey of the literature on the territorial history of the HRE, on the effects of ruler changes, and on the effects of state size.

## Territorial history in general

Within economics, the most popular studies on this are:
(start out by reading the recent studies and add their basic references here!)

More recent studies are:
- [Buonanno et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10887-022-09209-1): how size and fragmentation affected political history in Italy
- [Cervellati et al. (WP 2022)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qz0qz3zjskjo40p/DP13719-2.pdf?dl=0): theory of territorial competition and estimates of the impact of political geography on city growth
- [Schönholzer and Weese (WP 2022)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jb8m86mf8gbepak/europe_draft.pdf?dl=0): effect of switching between states on long-run urban growth
- [Cantoni, Weigand, and Mohr (2019)](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GZPPVE)'s documentation of the "Princes and Townspeople" data

All of the recent studies listed seem extremely relevant to me - regardless of which research question I decide on.

### Cantoni et al. (2019)
"We choose to consider the territorial holdings of lineages as territorial entities, rather than going by territory names or similar identifiers, as familial structures were the underlying drivers of territorial dynamics in the Holy Roman Empire." (p. 2)

"The history of the Holy Roman Empire is a history of its ruling families." (p. 3)

Breakup, restructuring and unification of territories were usually associated with ruler changes. (p. 3)

Actually read the "General approach" section. It's only three pages long. Then synthesise what you find, and these snippets, into a coherent summary in your own words.

## The optimal size of states

Within economics, the most popular studies on this are:
- [Alesina, Spolaore and Wacziarg (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.90.5.1276): theory of optimal number and size of countries as function of openness to trade
- [Alesina and Wacziarg (1998)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0047-2727(98)00010-3): smaller countries have higher government expenditure and are more open to trade
- [Alesina and Spolaore (1997)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951265): theory of optimal country size, given tradeoff between scale effects and heterogeneity
- [Easterly and Kraay (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0305-750X(00)00068-1): income of small states is higher but more volatile due to trade

## The effects of ruler changes

Within economics, the most popular studies on this are:
- [Jones and Olken (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/120.3.835): leadership changes affect country growth rates in the 20th century
- [DeLong and Shleifer (1993)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/725804): despotism is bad for long-run growth

More recent studies are:
- [Dube and Harish (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1086/707011): states experience more war under female leadership
- [Ottinger and Voigtländer (WP 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3386/w28297): ruler ability affects state performance

## Economic history methodologies

Potentially relevant papers about methodology:
- [Cantoni and Yuchtman (2020)](http://www.davidecantoni.net/pdfs/natural_experiments_chapter_20200128.pdf): conceptualising historical natural experiments

Papers whose methodology I could imitate:
- Jones and Olken (2005): Wald test to measure effect of ruler change
- [Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1257/0002828054201305): Triple diff to identify drivers of aggregate effect


## Generalised Diff-in-Diff

Prominent papers using this methodology:
- [Nunn and Qian (2011)](): not generalised, but full set of lags for time-varying effects
-
