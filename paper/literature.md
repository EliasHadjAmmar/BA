# Literature writeup

This document aims to give a survey of the literature on the territorial history of the HRE, on the effects of ruler changes, and on the effects of state size.

## Territorial history in general

Within economics, the most popular studies on this are:
(start out by reading the recent studies and add their basic references here!)

More recent studies are:
- [Buonanno et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10887-022-09209-1): how size and fragmentation affected political history in Italy
- [Cervellati et al. (WP 2022)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qz0qz3zjskjo40p/DP13719-2.pdf?dl=0): theory of territorial competition and estimates of the impact of political geography on city growth
- [Schönholzer and Weese (WP 2022)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jb8m86mf8gbepak/europe_draft.pdf?dl=0): effect of switching between states on long-run urban growth
- [Cantoni, Weigand, and Mohr (2019)](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GZPPVE)'s documentation of the "Princes and Townspeople" data

All of the recent studies listed seem extremely relevant to me - regardless of which research question I decide on.


Cantoni and Yuchtman (2014) say (as they write in the HHE 2020): "Legal training reduced the costs of trade and contract
enforcement in an environment that was highly politically fragmented." -> *implied fact: political fragmentation was associated with high cost of trade and contract enforcement*

### Cantoni et al. (2019)
"We choose to consider the territorial holdings of lineages as territorial entities, rather than going by territory names or similar identifiers, as familial structures were the underlying drivers of territorial dynamics in the Holy Roman Empire." (p. 2)

"The history of the Holy Roman Empire is a history of its ruling families." (p. 3)

Breakup, restructuring and unification of territories were usually associated with ruler changes. (p. 3)

Actually read the "General approach" section. It's only three pages long. Then synthesise what you find, and these snippets, into a coherent summary in your own words.

## The optimal size of states

Within economics, the most popular studies on this are:
- [Alesina, Spolaore and Wacziarg (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.90.5.1276): theory of optimal number and size of countries as function of openness to trade
- [Alesina and Wacziarg (1998)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0047-2727(98)00010-3): smaller countries have higher government expenditure and are more open to trade
- [Alesina and Spolaore (1997)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951265): theory of optimal country size, given tradeoff between scale effects and heterogeneity
- [Easterly and Kraay (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0305-750X(00)00068-1): income of small states is higher but more volatile due to trade

## The effects of ruler changes

Within economics, the most popular studies on this are:
- [Jones and Olken (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/120.3.835): leadership changes affect country growth rates in the 20th century
- [DeLong and Shleifer (1993)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/725804): despotism is bad for long-run growth

More recent studies are:
- [Dube and Harish (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1086/707011): states experience more war under female leadership
- [Ottinger and Voigtländer (WP 2022)](https://doi.org/10.3386/w28297): ruler ability affects state performance

## Generalised Diff-in-Diff

Prominent papers using this methodology:
- [Nunn and Qian (2011)](): not generalised, but full set of lags for time-varying effects

## Economic history methodologies

Potentially relevant papers about methodology:
- [Cantoni and Yuchtman (2020)](http://www.davidecantoni.net/pdfs/natural_experiments_chapter_20200128.pdf): conceptualising historical natural experiments

Papers whose methodology I could imitate:
- Jones and Olken (2005): Wald test to measure effect of ruler change
- [Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1257/0002828054201305): Triple diff to identify drivers of aggregate effect

### Cantoni and Yuchtman (2020)

Outline:
- intellectual history of the historical natural experiment
- taxonomy of motivations (non-exclusive)
    - experiments to understand history
    - experiments to understand economics
    - experiments to understand contemporary outcomes
- challenges

“(Historical) natural experiment”: any historical imposition of a “treatment”, evaluated relative to some counterfactual or control group.

#### Intellectual history
Credibility revolution: labour economists start to care about credible sources of variation (CAT 2)
Angrist and Krueger in the early 90s searched the past and present for variation that can identify the causal effect of interest.
Historical variation in policies, human-made events, and natural processes may provide cleaner tests of theory or better opportunities for estimation than any contemporary variation allows for.

Cliometric revolution: economic historians becomes quantitative like applied micro 
Set the stage for the incorporation of the credibility revolution into quantitative economic history (CAT 1).
Economic historians make causal arguments about the past using the quasi-experimental methods from applied micro.

2000s DevEcon: historical natural experiments are used as a credible alternative to RCTs
Development economists use HNEs to try to find ultimate drivers of growths (CAT 3), also (CAT 2) and (CAT 1), with RCTs as the benchmark

Confluence of these three in 
- Diamond (1997): species and continents as natural experiment
- Kremer (1993): human settlement as natural experiment
- Engerman and Sokoloff (1997): geographical endowments as natural experiments
- AJR (2001): disease environments as natural experiment

AJR unites the three currents especially powerfully:
- Quantitative economic history: builds on Engerman and Sokoloff's cliometric work; archival research.
- Credibility revolution of applied micro: credible, quasi-experimental research design.
- Experimental approach combined with big picture question about cross-country development.

#### Taxonomy

1. Papers that want to understand a specific historical episode or process
2. Papers that want to answer a theoretically founded question in economics
3. Papers that want to understand contemporary development

Which one of these could my paper be? From what angle should I present this?
Remember, my current empirical approach answers the question "do cities in larger territories grow faster or slower?"

##### Scenario: write a (CAT 1) paper
My prior is that this one fits worst. What would the historical episode or process be?
- Could be urban development. But "understanding urban development through the lens of territory changes" seems so awkward and ad hoc.
- Could be the dynamics of ruling families' rise and fall. But my current approach can barely tell us anything about that.
- Could be the spread of technology. Which is interesting but difficult.
- How political power gave rise to economic prosperity. This one I actually like.
- Could be the political integration of the fragmented HRE as a historical fact. Also works.

##### Scenario: write a (CAT 2) paper
Which theoretically founded question could I answer?
- What does the optimal size of states depend on? (Alesina and Spolaore 1997)
- Do bigger states experience faster technological progress? (Kremer 1993)
- Does regional political integration increase growth? (Alesina, Béla Balassa) - would be esp. interesting if I find negative effects.
- Does ruler quality have an effect on growth? (follow Jones and Olken 2005) - size is probably easier to identify.

I'm noticing an issue: if there are multiple plausible stories, then the stories I don't choose threaten the validity of the story I do choose. Is it size, integration, or political power? Is it internal or external power? I should choose the most *convincing* story. The paper should make a rhetorical point of distinguishing between the multiple alternative explanations.

##### Scenario: write a (CAT 3) paper
How could this help me understand contemporary development?
- Validity of results for today, for states, for other regions: probably all BS.
- Persistent effects: would be really difficult to show, I guess.
- as an instrument: for what?
I feel like I should read the section before I can do this properly. But my prior is that a diff-in-diff type experiment is ill-suited for this kind of paper, because the outcomes are, by design, contemporary to the treatment.



##### Interesting papers they talk about
- Dittmar and Seabold (2018): IV: printers' deaths -> treatment: printed output -> outcome: city growth
- Cantoni et al. (2018): use the same construction data I'm going to use

My conclusion: this is a (CAT 2) paper for sure, and I should consciously frame it as such.

#### Challenges

Generally: **"The weaknesses lie in the temptation to conduct very reduced form empirical analysis, and thus very narrow historical analysis, once a (seemingly) clean source of historical variation is identified."**

"We emphasize that the analysis of historical natural experiments is a *bridge*: historians must learn to do good applied econometrics, and non-historians must cross over and develop tools of historical analysis."

(CAT 1)

Looking under the lamppost: focusing too much on aspects that exhibit useful identifying variation while missing others.

Establishing the exogeneity of a quasiexperimental treatment can amount to arguing for the *inexplicability* of the historical variable of interest.

(CAT 2)

"Existence" results don't necessarily provide insights into the mechanisms producing that result.

Even cleanly identified results may be contingent on institutional and cultural setting (external validity).

(CAT 3)

Historical contingency.

Requires extremely careful historical work all along the causal chain, not merely understanding the moment of randomization itself.

"All of these critiques are best resolved by applying economic theory and deep historical understanding to one’s quasi-experimental research. This helps one generalize a local average treatment effect; it helps one understand how historical mechanisms act over time."
