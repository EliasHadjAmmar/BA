   Note: Table presents results of estimation equation \eqref{eq:baseline}. The switch type "Succession" is omitted as the  reference category. Yearly data was aggregated into periods of 50 years. Observations are at the city-period  level. The dependent variables are indicators that take the value 1 if  construction activity of the respective type was recorded. Standard errors are  clustered at the city level. *, **, and *** denote significance on the 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent  level, respectively.
