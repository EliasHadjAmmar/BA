  # NOTE: in the Princes and Townspeople data `terr_id` in the year of a switch
  # is recorded at the *end* of the period (i.e. the new owner). To use the empirical
  # framework of Sch√∂nholzer and Weese (2022) I have to recode it to the owner at the
  # *start* of the period. This means lagging it once.
  
  # Since I still want `type_change` to encode how the state in `terr_id` came
  # into power, I need to lag it once, as well.
  
  # This means: 
  # - `terr_id` is that of the initial state in each year
  # - `switch` codes whether a switch took place during this year
  # - `rule_{type}` codes how the state in `terr_id` came into power (as before)
